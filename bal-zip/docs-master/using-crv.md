?> By providing liquidity to Curve.fi, you get LP tokens such as yCRV, sCRV, cCRV, etc., for each pools respectively.

## How to get yCRV?

### Large funds

The transaction of swapping for yCRV from the official contract may cost about 0.3 ETH worth of gas, so this method is only ideal for large funds.

Go to [Curve's Y pool](https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit) and deposit any one or any combo of USDT/DAI/USDC/TUSD to get yCRV.

### Small funds

If you're playing with a small amount of fund, you may want to buy yCRV directly on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap). Set the target token to 0xdf5e0e81dff6faf3a7e52ba697820c5e32d806a8 (yCRV) and swap.

## How to get sCRV?

You can swap for sCRV at [this page](https://www.curve.fi/susdv2/deposit) of curve.fi. The procedure is similar to that of yCRV. The only difference is that there's no option for TUSD and instead it supports sUSD.

The liquidity of sCRV on Uniswap is not sufficient for use, so it is not advised to buy sCRV on it for now.

## How to get cCRV?

You can swap for cCRV at [this page](https://www.curve.fi/compound/deposit) of curve.fi. The procedure is similar to that of yCRV, but it only supports DAI and USDC.

The liquidity of cCRV on Uniswap is not sufficient for use, so it is not advised to buy cCRV from there for now.
