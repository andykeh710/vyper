?> The total supply of YFII token is 40,000 and all the tokens are distributed from two pools by a procedure called yield farming. Basically, you stake one kind of token into the pool and get YFII tokens as rewards.

## Pool 1: Curve yCRV

1. You'll need yCRV to farm YFII from Pool 1. You can get yCRV following [this guide](using-crv.md?id=how-to-get-ycrv).

2. Now you have yCRV in your wallet and are ready to farm YFII. Go to https://yfii.finance and click **Stake**. Open the **yearn** pool (Pool 1).

3. Click **Stake Tokens** and Metamask will ask you to authorize two transactions (one for permission to spend and the other for staking).

## Pool 2: DAI-YFII Balancer

1. You need DAI in your wallet before farming. Stake assets in Maker to borrow DAI or go to your favourite exchange to buy DAI.

2. Go to the [DAI-YFII balancer pool](https://bal.yfii.finance/#/pool/0x16cAC1403377978644e78769Daa49d8f6B6CF565) and setup **Balancer Proxy** first.

   a) If you have YFII, choose **All Pool Assets**.
Unlock **DAI** and **YFII** (0xa1d0E215a23d7030842FC67cE582a6aFa3CCaB83) by sending two transactions and then they become unlocked. Input the amount you are going to deposit in either box of DAI or YFII, and the page will input the corresponding amount of the other for you. Click **Add Liquidity** to send a transaction and then you get BPT.

   b) If you don't have YFII, choose **Single Asset**. Unlock **DAI** and input your deposit amount. Then click **Add Liquidity**. The system will buy the corresponding amount of YFII needed for you and then you get BPT.
